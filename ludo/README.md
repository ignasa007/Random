Consider a Snakes and Ladders grid. We use Markov chains to calculate the probability, $p$, of finishing the game in $n$ rolls. We play with a $6$ sided dice with equal probability of rolling on each of the faces, and assume that if rolling a number results in a position greater than the size of the grid, then you stay at the same position. For example, if you roll a $4$, $5$ or a $6$ when at position $97$ on a grid of size $100$, you'd stay at 97 (unlike a variation of the game where you'd finish in such a case).
