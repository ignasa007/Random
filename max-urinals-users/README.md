Having peed enought times in a urinal, I have observed the following patterns in my tendency to choose the urinal:
   1. When all the urinals are unoccupied, a new user tends to occupy the urinal farthest from the entry of the washroom.
   2. In all other cases, a new user tends to occupy the urinal which maximizes the minimum distance from other occupants.
   3. A user would wait instead of occupying a urinal right next to another user. There's creeps out there, y'all.
   
Now, assuming that everyone behaves like me, I wrote a code to calculate the number of men that pee at the same time in a washroom with $n$ urinals.
